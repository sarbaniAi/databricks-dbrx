However, the gap from the trend (see chart Fixed investment recovering faster but need more firepower) also suggests that fixed investment growth has been lower than desirable, and that some catching up remains to be done\\nMost of the catch-up in fixed investment has been led by government capex (centre, states, and public sector units) on infrastructure, which provided support during the pandemic when the private and household sectors were wary to invest. For fiscal 2024, with the budgetary increase in central capex at ~30%, we expect government capex to continue playing a bigger role in driving overall investment.

We arrive at this through a growth accounting framework that allows for capturing the role of capital, labour, and efficiency. We expect an increased contribution of capital to growth. Productivity growth, too, is likely increase further, as the fruits of reforms give yield.

Higher productivity can lead to faster GDP growth, all else being equal.\\nThis concept was quantified into a growth theory by Robert Solow, an American economist awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences for his important contributions to the theories of economic growth in his seminal paper of 1957. Through a mathematical equation, he was able to break down GDP growth into contribution from capital, labour and a ‘residual’, which captures the overall productivity growth in the economy.\\nThis concept is called ‘growth accounting’, through which we can explain growth dynamics and derive an economy’s productivity growth.\\nIn growth accounting, GDP is taken as the output from a ‘production function’, which is a combination of the factors of production (i.e., capital, labour) and total factor productivity (TFP), i.e., the overall efficiency with which the factors are combined: Y_t=A_t*F(K_t,L_t) where Yt is output at time t, Kt is capital stock, Lt is labour, and At is TFP growth.

Simply put, it is the share of capital in total income generated in the economy. Correspondingly, (1-a) is the share of labour in total income. This equation helps us derive the following relationship, which forms the basis of growth accounting:\\nGY=GA+ aGK+(1-a)GL\\nThis implies that output growth (i.e., GDP growth) is the sum of TFP (i.e., overall productivity) growth, and weighted average of capital and labour growth.',\n",

Last fiscal, a rebound in economic activity after the lifting of Covid-19-related lockdown was the key demand driver, thus supporting prices, while supply-chain disruptions and geopolitical risks led to an unprecedented increase in prices in a short span. While structural demand, driven by macroeconomic factors, remains one of the prime parameters impacting commodity prices, supply-side risks have emerged as the key drivers for the commodity price volatility over the past few years. The most prominent risks relate to supply chain and concentration.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The most prominent risks relate to supply chain and concentration.\\nSupply-chain risks: Supply-chain risks to commodity prices are related to the movement/ transportation of a commodity from the source of production to the consumption centre.\\nConcentration risks: While some commodities have supply risks associated, owing to lower magnitude of production vis-à-vis demand, there are commodities that have ample cumulative supply, but concentration within certain select geographies.\\nThis risk has historically been pronounced in mined commodities – including metals – which are based on their natural occurrence in a particular area.\\nWhile evident in price volatility in copper, which is concentrated in a few South American countries, concentration risk has been under the spotlight for commodities utilised in new-age applications such as PV-grade silicon and lithium hydroxide. Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia – the lithium triangle — account for almost 75% of the reserves, while refining and consumption are concentrated in China.\\nRisks arising from disruptions in supply chain have been witnessed time and again over the past decades, specifically in crude oil and natural gas.\\nThese factors multiply the risks of a substantial shortfall of lithium against growing demand, considering the significant lead times from exploration to setting up a full-scale mining plant for lithium.\\nFor instance, natural gas (spot LNG) prices surged almost four times following the decision by the EU to reduce reliance on Russian gas supplies. The EU’s substitution of Russian pipeline gas was impeded by the lack of LNG import/regasification capacity in north-west Europe and significantly higher cost of the alternative US-sourced LNG, which throttled demand.\\nThe scenario was no different for coking coal, where geopolitical tensions between Australia and China led to a shift in procurement strategies, impacting prices.\\nConsidering these factors, it is highly unlikely the prices of major commodities will revert to pre-Covid levels anytime soon.',\n",

Indeed, raw material costs declined to decadal lows. Power and fuel costs, selling expenses, and other expenses also declined on account of drop in the price of crude, slashed marketing spends, and cost optimisation efforts of companies during the pandemic.\\nHowever, the commodity supercycle that ensued thereafter lifted margins of commodity players in our sample set to a decadal high of 25.9% last fiscal, and the share of these margins to 27%. Margins of these players anyway move in line with the commodity cycle and tend to be volatile.\\nIn fiscal 2023, with the commodity cycle cooling, we estimate a 180-220 bps decline in margins, with the commodity segment accounting for 80% of decline. Margins of non-commodity players will decline marginally too, with lagged effects in the commodity price hikes and delayed pass-through to end prices.\\nIn fiscal 2024, with commodity prices declining further, the margins of both these segments are expected to settle at pre-Covid levels.\\nAt the other end, for non-commodity players, whose margins are largely rangebound, higher commodity prices led to a decline in margins that year.',\n",

       "  'content': 'But with transition come risks.\\nHere, we focus on three significant ones on the horizon, and their implications.\\nWe see the green transition occurring in three stages — first, capitalising on existing technologies, second, focussing on cost reduction of evolving technologies to sharply reduce emissions, and third, deep decarbonisation for achieving carbon neutrality.\\nIndia might remain in the first stage till 2030, though investments in newer technologies are gathering pace.\\nSo far, investments are focussed mainly on two sectors: renewable energy and transportation. They are predominantly for developing alternative fuels, electric vehicles, and new technologies such as green hydrogen.\\nWe estimate these investments account for ~9% of total infrastructure investments and a minuscule proportion of industrial investments, as of fiscal 2023. That could rise to 15% by fiscal 2027.\\n40% of revenue of companies in 40 sectors is climate- transition sensitive\\nClimate-linked sensitivity refers to the likely impact of green transition on revenues of sectors for a variety of reasons. It could be because existing products are being replaced by greener ones, or sectors have high exposure to/dependence on natural resources, or have high emission production processes that may impact costs (say, due to higher costs of regulatory compliance), and\\nhence, competitiveness in specific markets.\\nOur assessment of 40 sectors, comprising 780 companies, indicates 40% of their revenues have high emission intensity and dependence on natural resources.\\nFurther evaluation indicates that ~75% of these sensitive sectors need high technology disruption and a long tail period to drive their transition, implying higher costs to be incurred over a longer period (see chart below).',\n",

So, in general there's a lot of noise around RBI having a discussion with banks on LDR,\\nplus deposit growth has been very, very tight in November and December irrespective of whether\\nyou've had a discussion with RBI or not. So how do you view deposit growth and LDR from\\nPage 5 of 21\\nClassification - Public\\nClassification - Public\\nHDFC Bank Limited January 16, 2024\\nhere on? If you could give us some sense, target or guidance on how LDR will pan out, or what\\nLDR are you looking at, in FY '25?\\nAnd a related question to that is that if deposit taking remains tight irrespective of the LDR\\ndebate, then what would you choose? Would you choose to offer higher rates compared to\\ncompetition because you ask rate for deposits is on the higher side now?\",\n",

If I miss anything, come back, but let me start with your first\\none in terms of the deposits and the CD ratio itself, right? It probably addresses a broader point\\nthat many of them would have. If you think about -- first of all, any conversations with RBI is\\nconfidential, and it is between the regulator and the bank. So we will not be able to talk about\\nany individual conversations or anything else. Keep that aside, your main point is in terms of\\nthe rate of growth of deposits as well as on the CD ratio, given where it is. So let's talk about\\nthat.\\nNow on the deposits if you see. Firstly, on the deposits I do want to mention that how we\\napproached it here. At an overall level, our deposits grew by INR411 billion. At an overall level,\\nour deposits were at that level. So INR411 billion. That's the total growth that we had. Within\\nthat, if you see the retail deposit growth of INR530 billion and 2.9% during the quarter.\\nHowever, non-retail deposits reduced by INR118 billion, INR118 billion quarter-on-quarter it\\nreduced, almost 3.3% reduction sequentially in the nonretail deposit. Again, it is a very price\\nsensitive space. We chose not to participate and get that price thing up. And we wanted to focus\\nmore and more on granular there. So that's one.\",\n",

And the savings account deposits I'll\\ncome back and talk about the savings as such, right? There is something on the savings which is\\n-- we need to see that, right - where you are seeing two things on savings.

And one other measure or yardstick, we look at -- aggregate of our card\\ncustomers, what is the balance that they have, right? If you look at the card ANR versus the\\ndeposit against it, almost 5.4x they have, right? That means for every 100 that I have as my card\\nbalance outstanding, I have 5.4x that in my savings -- in my deposit account in the bank.\\nSo there seems to be more spending room there to go. So that's one. And from a rate cycle point\\nof view. And how do you overcome that is to get more customers. I talked about 2.2 million\\ncustomers, 7.4 million. These are the kind of what we have.

When you think about deposits\\nthis quarter instead of say the INR400 billion that you accreted, if you had to double or triple\\nthat number, which is the biggest constraint? Is it the LCR, where you are hitting the constraint?\\nOr is it simply the cost of deposits, or is it the lack of good lending opportunities? Where are\\nyou seeing the biggest constraint?\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Yes. The biggest constraint is in the area of deposits, right? And if you look at what has happened\\nin the system, very important to look at the liquidity in the system, how it has moved. If you see,\\nit has been positive ever since Q1 '20. The system liquidity has been positive since Q1 '20. And\\nnow it has moved to a negative territory. All the way, if you look right now, this is the first\\nquarter -- full quarter - Q3, that it is a negative INR664 billion, right? That's the negative situation\\nin the quarter, system has gone down by, that's the average that you're seeing.\\nSo it is the lack of liquidity in the system. Rightfully so if you look at how RBI has managed,\\nthere is no rate change that has happened. But the inflation that spiked four months ago, five\\nmonths ago, has been managed through liquidity constraints, right, through working on the\\nliquidity side. That is what has happened on a temporary basis.\\nBut over quarter-to-quarter, this is happening, but it is coming after more than three years, three\\nand a half years, right?

Because if I look\\nat it this quarter, you have sold off INR50,000 crores, your LCR is at 110%, you can't go below\\nthat. There is no excess liquidity assets at 110% LCR, right, and funding costs may remain\\nelevated. So when you are saying I want to go from 3.4% to 3.7%, incremental CASA\\nmobilization is getting to be a challenge.\\nTerm deposit growth is high. Your HDFC Limited borrowings are sitting there at 70-odd percent.\\nSo deposit growth is looks difficult to meet your own loan growth requirements. When are you\\ngoing to replace the eHDFC Limited liabilities. So amidst all these challenges, what will drive\\nyour margins, say, from 3.4% to 3.7%, say, over the course of next 18 to 24 months?\\nWill it be yield on loans? Because it doesn't look like it can go through cost of funds? That's the\\nfirst question. If you can elaborate the movement in margins. Some indication as to what will be\\nthe components and how are you going to manage the eHDFC Limited liability replacement\\nwith deposits, point number one?\\nAnd the second thing is, 1,500 branches doesn't look like it's happening this year because we\\nhave only opened 290 branches -- sorry, 270 this year. So going to fall short of your 1,500\\nbranches target by a wide margin. What is the thought process there? Over to you, Srini.\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: Okay. Yes, thank you.\",\n",

And that is something that will help us to go. And off late, in the recent times, if you see,\\nwe haven't had that kind of a market rate of growth on the unsecured as such. Our personal loan\\nhas been growing 2% to 3% over the last two quarters.\\nSo we do have opportunity space there.

And the mortgage is another big opportunity that we have, both existing customers,\\nwhere we have almost 4.8 million preapproved, prequalified databases to go through, which we\\nhave done in our existing base who are eligible that we are making offers and talking about it.\\nAnd also 5.6 million customers who already have somewhere we are targeting that.\\nSo that's -- in terms of the retail mix needs to go up, that is an enhancer for the margin. And to\\nsome extent, it picks up on the ROA too, right? So that's an important mix. That's not what we\\nhave seen in recent times. In the recent times, the wholesale growth has been overwhelming the\\nretail loan growth. We do need to reverse that. That's part of the process in terms of what we are\\ngoing through.\\nNow getting to what are the other levers, which you also mentioned, but there are headwinds on\\nthat, right, CASA ratio. We are at 37.7%. Even before merger, we were 42%. Over a long period\\nof time, we were 42%, 43% thereabouts. We are confident of getting the CASA ratio back up.\\nThere are two aspects to the CASA ratio.

You guys have said you will bring down from\\n40% to 35% over the course of next five years. I know it's a long journey, the fact that you're\\nopening lower number of branches.

Sorry. Thanks. It's the last question.\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: We are with you, Suresh, on that. Yes, we do expect normally -- while we don't give a forward-\\nlooking outlook, but on the cost to income, we have always said that we want to take it down to\\nthe mid-30s.

Listen, both are important. It's like you need to walk and chew gum, right? You need to\\ndo both, which means LCR, as we have said before that we'd like to operate between 110% to\\n120%. We were at several quarters, 113%, 114%, 115% thereabouts. Then for a quarter, we went\\nup, and then we have consumed -- as we see in this quarter, we have consumed, right?

We do want to ensure that the mix of funding moves more towards\\ndeposits. So LDR is important from that sense. And if you see, currently 110%. Then if you look\\nat where can this go. Where can this LDR go? You look at our LDR prior to merger, it's very\\nimportant, right, a recent discussion that is developing. Prior to merger, our LDR was at 85%,\\nright? Then now it's at 110%. And if you remove the merger effect of the assets and the deposits\\non this, the LDR is more like a 89%, right.\\nAnd if you look at our historical range of what the bank has operated LDR over a long period of\\ntime, around that 85%, 87% that's kind of a range that's where we operated, historically, if you\\nthink about our LDR, that's where we operated. So the -- and today, if you strip out the merger\\neffect, it's about 89%.

So growth is not something that we are\\ncaught up with saying this is the rate of growth that we want. Over a period of time, we want to\\nbecause that's the investment we have done, we need to harvest returns on those.\\nSo we are focused on returns. So that takes you to the margin, right, would you focus on margin\\nor growth. We certainly do not want growth for the sake of growth.

So is this a new\\ntrajectory that we're looking at? Or you'll go back to 1,500 or thereabouts in the following years?\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: See, again, I'll tell you one other constraint that we are also working through on the branches\\nwith this URC. This URC is something that is required, right. The mix between the unbanked\\nrural centre and so on. Selecting that availability. What is that URC that is available so that we\\nare able to get that mix appropriately. So there is a targeted percentage with a regulatory target\\non URC that is more internally we would do, but we need to have a mix between the URC and\\nthe non-URC so that we can grow progressively across in a balanced manner within the\\nregulatory approval. So that is what it is.\\nSo if you look at whether we go back to 1,500, I think Sashi has alluded to that over a period of\\ntime, we do want to get to the 13,000, 14,000 type of branches, not just for the sake of branches.\\nIt is the geographical presence that we can have so we can tap into the pockets of both the\\ndeposits and lending opportunity in that area. So it's not just deposit, deposits and also the\\nlending opportunity in the area. So we would be there, but there is no hard kind of -- we're not\\ngoing to push ahead with only one number.

The conversation would never go to say, I'm the best price to\\ndeposits, come here.

So if you look at one month, the last\\nmonth, the December -- In October, we showed to the broader world in terms of how various\\ndigital approach that we have taken to offering this bundling of products. Savings account is an\\nimportant part of the product suite that we offer.\\nAmong the disbursals that we had, in one month, if you take 40,000-plus disbursals, first\\ndisbursals because I'm not counting for the disbursals which are on-going, right, second\\ninstalment, third instalment, leave that to the side. On the first disbursals that have happened in\\nthe month -- in December, roughly half-half is, existing to bank and new to bank, half-half of\\nthat. Among that half, which is the new to bank, almost 65% of them we have penetrated with\\nthe savings deposit.\\nSo we've gone with the 65% penetration to start with, I'm talking about the December, where we\\nare. And that penetration comes with the deposit balance, at least one to two months of EMI,\\nwhich is INR30,000 to INR35,000 on an average we have taken from the customer base where\\nwe have opened. So we'll publish this. So one is savings account as a product and what is the\\npenetration on that. That's number one. And I give you an example of 65% of new to bank, first\\ndisbursals, we have had that, and we want to take it to 90, 95, 99.\\nWe'll keep tracking and reporting that. The second one is the credit cards. We're just beginning\\non that one, we will report on that as a product in terms of how we are offering credit cards. The\\nthird is consumer durable.\",\n",

So, can one surmise that because of good\\napps available on mobile devices, consumers are now being very active and not giving in to the\\ninertia on both the asset side, the credit cards, they are not revolving.\\nThey are just taking personal loan or something? And similarly on the liability side, the slot\\nconsumers are moving away their deposits to an account where they're getting 7%, 8%, whereas\\nwe are giving, let's say, 3.5%. So have you done any behavioural analysis on both assets as well\\nas liability side to see how across the broad spectrum of your customers, is there any data to\\nprove through these thesis?\\nSrinivasan Vaidyanathan: See, in terms of the customers -- you touched upon the revolver. Thank you for touching upon\\nthat. See, the revolvers haven't grown. If anything, actually, in this quarter, we do -- we did see\\na slight reduction in revolver percentage, right? We're not seeing that. And in some other\\nquestions, I would allude to how card bunch of customers. Customers who have credit cards and\\nsavings accounts with us and you see their balances are five times, little more than five times --\\n5.4 times their balances is what they have in the deposit accounts.\\nSo that is also healthy. It was less than four, three years ago. Now it is 5.4. So it has grown.\\nThat's the second thing. The third thing in terms of whether some of the digital properties are\\nenabling, less use of card revolving and alternatives. See, in our customer segment, that's not\\nsomething that we are seeing because it is – which is more of -- the segment that we have chosen\\nand working on is little more higher rate.\\nThat means little higher score customers.\",\n",

I think we have talked about the revolver one to three\\nmonths and four to six months and six-plus months -- call it, six-plus months revolvers. Across\\nthese three revolving categories, we are not seeing pickup happening. So that's part of the\\ncustomer base, and that's part of the cash that they have, or some of them have got impacted\\nthrough the COVID and come out of it and not survived and come through it and not indulging\\nin any of these things.\\nAnd some of them who do, take it for a short period of time, right? So that's the one to three\\nmonths category if you see they take for some short personal loan or they don't want a two-year\\nor a three-year or whatever the tenor, personal loan, they want it for a short period of time, they\\ndon't mind taking it.

So we have enormous room to go. The\\nother aspect is that whether alternative payments UPI or anything, those kind of things or direct\\ndebit system, that would only increase the balances in the savings account. So somebody who is\\nusing UPI previously was drawing down cash and paying through.\\nSo the cash was going out of the bank. Now the cash is in the bank account and is using UPI. So\\nit only enhances -- anybody using UPI only enhances balances in the account. So there are pluses\\nand minuses across all of these.

Yes, there may be some\\ncustomers who go. But from our rate offering point of view, we offer -- you're talking about the\\nsavings account rate. But on a time savings account rate is what we offer, 3%, 3.5%.\\nOn the term deposit, we are more or less in line with the competition, significant peers. If you\\nsee, we are more or less in line with that on a term deposit rate point of view. From a savings\\naccount, yes, we do continue to -- that doesn't mean somebody else cannot grow.
